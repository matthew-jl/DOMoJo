DOMoJo is a social challenge tracker that helps you stay consistent and accountable by joining daily or weekly challenges in areas like fitness, technology, study, art, and more. Whether you're working out, coding, reading, or learning a new skill, DOMoJo gives you a space to share your progress, build habits, and connect with others on the same journey.


This project was developed in collaboration with my fellow lab assistant, Vernandio Rivaldo. We followed the standards required for uploading the application to the Google Play Store.

**Tech Stack:** Kotlin, XML, Firebase.
